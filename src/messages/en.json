      "firstParagraph": "So here we are travelling in South East Asia and trying to absorb as much as possible. We said we really needed to document it somehow, so we decided to start writing about our experience and how we are managing to balance travel and work. There are lots of amazing bloggers who do this already but we have found there are things which still haven't been talked about. Incredible but true. In fact, there is so much to write about that we will never manage to give you a true image of what we see.",
      "secondParagraph": "Living in London for 6 years has been an amazing eye-opener. We have met people from all over the world who, as well as making our stay there really special, have just accentuated our desire to explore the world as much as possible. You soon get hooked on peoples' travel stories and just want to hear more and experience them yourself. Funnily enough, the stories you hear are always the ones where things have gone badly wrong and are the ones people remember forever. We will never forget our time in Luang Prabang during the burning season, but although it wasn't what we had hoped for, we will always cherish it as it showed us something that the people who live there have to endure.",
      "thirdParagraph": "We are interested in learning from cultures which are new to us, by trying new foods and seeing the cooking techniques, discovering parts of history which were never taught at school, seeing how different religions influence entire communities and meeting people who live here and others who are just travelling like us. The human connections are the most touching and it happens in such a natural way that you start to believe you could happily spend your whole life getting to know people - maybe not an ideal scenario for introverts, and that's fine as well.",
      "fourthParagraph": "Unfortunately, we can't spend all our time socialising as we are working too. Actually, it's only fair, as it's what is allowing us to travel non-stop. We are flexible and don't have a travel itinerary, but one of the cons/pros about having to work whilst travelling is that fast Wifi is about the only thing you need (as well as the electricity of course) and sometimes this forces us to have to stay in bigger towns or cities for longer and miss out on the smaller ones unless it's just a weekend trip.",
      "fifthParagraph": "We are also trying to go on fewer flights as possible and travel mainly by train, bus and boat. We strongly believe that as we are able to stay in places for longer we can also spend more time getting there. As well as having less of an environmental impact you get a good view of the scenery around you!",
      "sixthParagraph": "Thank you for visiting our blog, where we share our stories, with a particular focus on the places we visit. We want to give you an authentic glimpse of what these places are really like, and to bring you along on our journey. Through our writing, we aim to provide you with informative and engaging content that will give you insights into the different cultures, histories, and landscapes we encounter.",
      "seventhParagraph": "We hope that our blog inspires you to explore the world and that you enjoy reading about our travels as much as we enjoy sharing them with you."

    "Beatrice": {
      "firstParagraph": "Ever since I finished University, I've been dreaming about discovering new places.",
      "secondParagraph": "As I'm writing this, I'm sitting in a Thai beach bar made of driftwood with mon khwans or axe pillows and low tables and is far enough from the beach to not get sand in our devices, it's 5pm and we have just ordered cocktails which come decorated with a slice of pineapple and an orchid flower, they are Â£3 and it's on this beach with about ten people sitting on the sand waiting for the sunset.",
      "thirdParagraph": "So far everything seems easy and we are enjoying the tiny but amazing everyday thrills from just seeing the new and unknown. It's been nice to meet both local people and others who are on different or similar journeys to ours.",
      "fourthParagraph": "It's also refreshing seeing different things, tasting new foods and being in such a relaxed country. The flexibility of being freelance and splitting the day into half discover and half work, yeah, you will loose out on a few evenings a week, trying to fit in with EU timezones, but you decide when and how.",
      "fifthParagraph": "I generally feel very relaxed and it's also been great to be able to have everything I need inn1 rucksack and a bag, but still having a bit of home thanks tolthe things which were given to me by family and friend can already hear my parents and brother Williams laughing at the cthat I have never managed to travel lightly.",
      "sixthParagraph": "A month and a half has gone by and we're only in February, so let's see what comes next!"

    "Davide": {
      "firstParagraph": "My love for travel is something that has developed over time. I first realised this while on an Interrail in 2018 with Bea. We travelled from Bulgaria all the way up to the Netherlands, experiencing different cultures and discovering new ways of life.",
      "secondParagraph": "Since then I dreamed of being able to travel around the world, and in my 2 years working at Culture Trip I was constantly discovering interesting facts and places I had never heard of before.",
      "thirdParagraph": "Last year, an opportunity arose to work remotely for a company, which meant I could work from anywhere in the world at any time of day. It was the sign I had been waiting for, and I knew I had to take the chance.",
      "fourthParagraph": "Bea and I decided to start planning our trip around the world. Just a few weeks after starting my new job, we took a leap of faith and booked our one-way plane ticket to our first destination: Bangkok. We didn't have much of a plan, but we were ready for an adventure.",
      "fifthParagraph": " I love discovering new styles of living and seeing how people from different cultures approach life. It challenges my own beliefs and helps me learn from the better parts of theirs, though not always with great success."
