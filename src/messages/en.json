      "firstParagraph": "Ever since I finished University, I've been dreaming about discovering new places.",
      "secondParagraph": "As I'm writing this, I'm sitting in a Thai beach bar made of driftwood with mon khwans or axe pillows and low tables and is far enough from the beach to not get sand in our devices, it's 5pm and we have just ordered cocktails which come decorated with a slice of pineapple and an orchid flower, they are Â£3 and it's on this beach with about ten people sitting on the sand waiting for the sunset.",
      "thirdParagraph": "So far everything seems easy and we are enjoying the tiny but amazing everyday thrills from just seeing the new and unknown. It's been nice to meet both local people and others who are on different or similar journeys to ours.",
      "fourthParagraph": "It's also refreshing seeing different things, tasting new foods and being in such a relaxed country. The flexibility of being freelance and splitting the day into half discover and half work, yeah, you will loose out on a few evenings a week, trying to fit in with EU timezones, but you decide when and how.",
      "fifthParagraph": "I generally feel very relaxed and it's also been great to be able to have everything I need inn1 rucksack and a bag, but still having a bit of home thanks tolthe things which were given to me by family and friend can already hear my parents and brother Williams laughing at the cthat I have never managed to travel lightly.",
      "sixthParagraph": "A month and a half has gone by and we're only in February, so let's see what comes next!"

      "firstParagraph": "My love for travel is something that has developed over time. I first realised this while on an Interrail in 2018 with Bea. We travelled from Bulgaria all the way up to the Netherlands, experiencing different cultures and discovering new ways of life.",
      "secondParagraph": "Since then I dreamed of being able to travel around the world, and in my 2 years working at Culture Trip I was constantly discovering interesting facts and places I had never heard of before.",
      "thirdParagraph": "Last year, an opportunity arose to work remotely for a company, which meant I could work from anywhere in the world at any time of day. It was the sign I had been waiting for, and I knew I had to take the chance.",
      "fourthParagraph": "Bea and I decided to start planning our trip around the world. Just a few weeks after starting my new job, we took a leap of faith and booked our one-way plane ticket to our first destination: Bangkok. We didn't have much of a plan, but we were ready for an adventure.",
      "fifthParagraph": " I love discovering new styles of living and seeing how people from different cultures approach life. It challenges my own beliefs and helps me learn from the better parts of theirs, though not always with great success."

    "Generic": {
      "firstParagraph": "So far, our journey has been a great experience, one that we'll remember for the rest of our lives, and we've only just begun. It's the details and subtleties which surprise us and are making us fall in love with all these new cultures.",
      "secondParagraph": "Thank you for visiting our blog, where we share our stories, with a particular focus on the places we visit. We want to give you an authentic glimpse of what these places are really like, and to bring you along on our journey.
