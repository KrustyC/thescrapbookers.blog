          Ever since I finished University, I{"'"}ve been dreaming about
          discovering new places.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I{"'"}m writing this, I{"'"}m sitting in a Thai beach bar made of
          drift wood with mon khwans or axe pillows and low tables and is far
          enough from the beach to not get sand in our devices, it{"'"}s 5pm and
          we have just ordered cocktails which come decorated with a slice of
          pineapple and an orchid flower, they are Â£3 and it{"'"}s on this beach
          with about ten people sitting on the sand waiting for the sunset.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far everything seems easy and we are enjoying the tiny but amazing
          everyday thrills from just seeing the new and unknown. It{"'"}s been
          nice to meet both local people and others who are on different or
          similar journeys to ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          It{"'"}s also refreshing seeing different things, tasting new foods
          and being in such a relaxed country. The flexibility of being
          freelance and splitting the day into half discover and half work,
          yeah, you will loose out on a few evenings a week, trying to fit in
          with EU timezones, but you decide when and how.
        </p>
        <p>
          I generally feel very relaxed and it{"'"}s also been great to be able
          to have everything I need in one 1 rucksack and a bag, but still
          having a bit of home thanks to all the things which were given to me
          by family and friends. I can already hear my parents and brother
          Williams laughing at the fact that I have never managed to travel
          lightly.
        </p>

        <p>
          A month and a half has gone by and we{"'"}re only in February, so let
          {"'"}s see what comes next!

          My love for travel is something that has developed over time. I first
          realised this while on an Interrail in 2018 with Bea. We travelled
          from Bulgaria all the way up to the Netherlands, experiencing
          different cultures and discovering new ways of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since then I dreamed of being able to travel around the world, and in
          my 2 years working at Culture Trip I was constantly discovering
          interesting facts and places I had never heard of before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Last year, an opportunity arose to work remotely for a company, which
          meant I could work from anywhere in the world at any time of day. It
          was the sign I had been waiting for, and I knew I had to take the
          chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bea and I decided to start planning our trip around the world. Just a
          few weeks after starting my new job, we took a leap of faith and
          booked our one-way plane ticket to our first destination: Bangkok. We
          didn{"'"}t have much of a plan, but we were ready for an adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love discovering new styles of living and seeing how people from
          different cultures approach life. It challenges my own beliefs and
          helps me learn from the better parts of theirs, though not always with
          great success.

          So far, our journey has been a great experience, one that we{"'"}ll
          remember for the rest of our lives, and we{"'"}ve only just begun. It{"'"}s
          the details and subtleties which surprise us and are making us fall in
          love with all these new cultures.
